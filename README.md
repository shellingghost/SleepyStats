With this application, you can put in your Sleepy Stats which will allow you to see correlations between your
daily activity goals you've set for yourself and how they relate to your general mood. Seeing this visualization
will empower users to take control of their habits and live more proactively. The application output is a graph
you can save to your desktop. Created for the hackathon AutumnnHacks.
